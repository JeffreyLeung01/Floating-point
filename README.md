# Floating-point-numbers
Two python programs, one is to convert decimal numbers into binary representation of floating point, for example convert 7.375 to 401d80000 (11 bit exponent and 24 bit significant)
The other is to convert binary representation back to decimal, for example convert c05d00000 to -116 (11 bit exponent and 24 bit significant)

##How to use
1. You must have Python 3 installed on your machine to run
2. Download all the files
3. Put the files in a same folder
4. Right click "binaryRepresentationToDecimal.py" or "decimalToBinaryRepresentation.py"
5. Press edit with IDLE
6. Press f5
7. Enter the number of bits to represent exponent
8. Enter the number of bits to represent significant
9. Enter the hexadecimal number or decimal number you want to convert

##License 
You are free to download, use, edit, modify and distribute this code, but only if you include this README file

##Disclaimer
This converter is for reference only, it might not be free of bugs
The program uses a lot of string methods, so it is quite slow
Do not use this program to cheat in exams
